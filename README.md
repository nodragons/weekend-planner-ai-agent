## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Google API credentials (for Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- Google ADK installed

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd WeekendPlanner
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure Google ADK:
   - Set up your Google Cloud credentials
   - Configure the GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key-here" environment variable
   -   run this comment "echo 'GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"' > .env"

## Usage

### Running the Agent

run this command "adk web"

### Agent Architecture

The system uses a multi-agent hierarchy:

0. **Input Parser**: Checks user input
1. **Weather Agent**: Checks weather conditions
2. **Weather Router**: Routes to appropriate activity planning based on weather
3. **Activity Research Group** (runs when weather is good):
   - Local Activities Agent: Finds nearby activities
   - Special Events Agent: Discovers festivals and events
4. **Home Activities Agent**: Suggests indoor activities when weather is poor
5. **Summarizer Agent**: Consolidates findings into recommendations

## Configuration

Key agents use `gemini-2.5-flash` model. Customize by modifying:
- `model` parameter in agent definitions
- `instruction` prompts for different agent behaviors
- Tool selection (currently uses Google Search)

## Output

The system generates a concise, bulleted summary with:
- Area and weather information
- Child ages
- 3-5 key activity recommendations
- Disclaimer about AI-generated results
